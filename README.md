# Password Strength Assessment Tool

This Python script assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria, including length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Overview

The `password_strength_assessment.py` script evaluates the strength of a password by checking the following criteria:

- Length: Password must be at least 8 characters long.
- Uppercase Letters: Password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
- Lowercase Letters: Password must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
- Numbers: Password must contain at least one digit (0-9).
- Special Characters: Password must contain at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).

Based on these criteria, the script categorizes the password into one of the following strength levels:

- **Very Strong**: Password meets all criteria.
- **Strong**: Password meets most criteria.
- **Moderate**: Password meets some criteria.
- **Weak**: Password meets minimal criteria.
- **Very Weak**: Password does not meet essential criteria.
